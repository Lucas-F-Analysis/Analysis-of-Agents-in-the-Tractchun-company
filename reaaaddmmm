# 🎯 Performance Analysis of IT Agents – Tractchun Company

## 📊 Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of the IT support team at Tractchun, a manufacturing company. Using data from ticketing systems and HR records, I created a Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into agent performance, ticket resolution times, and service satisfaction. The analysis is designed to optimize support operations and improve strategic decision-making.
